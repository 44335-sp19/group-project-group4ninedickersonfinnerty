            <p>Caroline is currently a full time student at Northwest Missouri State University, focusing on getting her Bachlors of Science in Computer Science and minoring in Digital Media. She has built simple rpgs, coded two websites for two clients and the website you are looking at right now! Caroline doesn't back down from new experiences and takes doubt as a challenge. Caroline is determined to break into the development industry and code. She has done this so far by spending her summers at Rivet and GlynnDevins and coding for them. Having learned a multitude from each company, she is looking for her next learning opportunity. </p>

            <p>Completed in the Web Development 2 course, this project was a group project. We were given a client and had to meet their criteria for what they needed in their site for their business. A &amp; M Amusements needed to have a e-commerce front that allowed users to add inflateables and other products to their cart, pick a day for their rental and check out. The client asked that when a user checks out a product, that he be notified along with the user getting a confimation email. The brand colors were red white and blue, and the site had to have a fun kid feeling while still looking like a respectable site. We acomplished this by keeping cosmetics minimal while useing fun colors. <br/>My role in this project was to focus on getting the site built to the standards of the mockup my group members had given me, and building all the functionality required. The checkout function was built from scratch as we were not allowed to use frameworks. I used jQuery to store what products were added to the cart to the windows session in the cookies. When the user went to the checkout page, there would be a four loop that would go through the cookies and print all the products selected and their price. If the user removed a product from their cart that item was also cleared from the list in the cookies. </p>

            <h3 class="text-right">Programming 2 RPG Project</h3>
            <p class="text-right">Completed in the Computer Programming 2 course, the RPG project required that there be 5 different player classes, 5 different types of monsters, and 5 scenes. To help keep the overall code short and sweet, methods were created to take care of the repetative task in RPG's such as battles, and user prompts. At the start of each turn the user would be prompted with the question of which direction they would like to move next. The user would respond with either North, South, East or West. If the player entered an invalid command the program would call them silly and ask that they try again. <br/> After picking a direction they would either happen appon a scene or start a monster encounter. The scene would just tell the character what they saw, and then move into having them pick another direction. The monster encounter would ask the player if they would like to fight or try to run. If the player tried to run, the program would "roll a dice" and determine if the player is able to get away. If the player is unlucky they would take damage and lose the encounter. If the player chooses to fight, the program would also "roll a dice" to determine if the player is succesful. Winning in a monster fight means your character earned points, losing means you lost health points. The game would end when the user either quits or loses all their health points.</p>
