            <h3 class="text-left"> Portrait</h3>
            <p>This is a project I completed in my Computer Graphics class. The objective of the project is to create a portrait of yourself. The only thing we were allowed to use to create the portrait was a picture of ourselves. The rest of the project we had to create everything else using illustrator, and not download anything from the internet. I got the inspiration for this project from Obama's famous "Change" poster. </p>

            <p class="text-right"> This was a project I had to complete in my typography class. I like this project because I learned how to best balance typography elements, spacing, and images into an organized spec sheet. We were only given the text from the client, their logo, and some pictures. We were then tasked with trying to best organize the data and display it in the best way possible.  </p>
